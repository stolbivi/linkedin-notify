            <p><strong><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>

            <ul role="list">
              <li><strong>Consent. </strong>We may      process your information if you have given us permission      (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific      purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.</li>

              <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We      may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect      your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as      situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.</p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>If      collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot      be obtained in a timely way</li>
              <li>For      investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
              <li>For      business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
              <li>If it      is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to      assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
              <li>For      identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next      of kin</li>
              <li>If we      have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be      victim of financial abuse</li>
              <li>If it      is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise      the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is      reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement      or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
              <li>If      disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or      rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
              <li>If it      was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,      or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which      the information was produced</li>
              <li>If the      collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
              <li>If the      information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
            </ul>

              <li><strong>Affiliates. </strong>We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we      will require those affiliates to honor this privacy notice.      Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture      partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common      control with us.</li>
              <li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We      may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain      products, services, or promotions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</em></p>
            <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
            <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@lnmanager.com" target="_blank">support@lnmanager.com</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
            <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.

            <p><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
